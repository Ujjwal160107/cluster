# CI-003 — `helm template` every Helm-sourced Application with the values this repo actually uses,
# so the rendered output can be schema-checked (kubeconform) alongside the Kustomize manifests.
#
# Why: for the Helm-sourced apps, git holds only a values overlay — the chart lives in a Helm repo or
# in another Git repository. Nothing in this repo's CI looked at that combination, so a bad values key
# (a typo, a key the chart renamed, a value of the wrong type) reached the cluster as a failed or
# *silently different* sync. `helm template` is the cheap local render of exactly what ArgoCD will do.
#
# Two chart shapes are handled, distinguished by whether the source names a `path`:
#   - a Helm repository (`repoURL` + no path)  -> `helm template --repo <repoURL> --version <rev>`
#   - a chart inside a Git repository (`path`) -> shallow-clone `repoURL` at `targetRevision` and
#     template from `<clone>/<path>`
#
# VCAP's charts are deliberately absent: their repositories are private, so CI here cannot fetch them,
# and their renders belong in VCAP's own CI (CI-006). This script reports anything it skipped rather
# than passing silently.
#
# Usage: scripts/helm-template-all.sh [OUTFILE]   (default: stdout)
# Exit: 0 only if every Helm-sourced Application rendered.
