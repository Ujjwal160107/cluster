"""CI-002 (partial) — every Application `path:` that points at THIS repo must exist.

Why this exists: ArgoCD resolves an Application's `path` at sync time, so a typo, a renamed
directory, or a directory deleted without its Application/ApplicationSet element produces a
*comparison error on the cluster* rather than a failure in review. The cluster is the last place to
find that out, and an app whose path is missing sits degraded until someone reads its status.

It checks four things, all of them within this repo:

1. every Application/ApplicationSet/bootstrap `sources[].path` (or `source.path`) whose `repoURL` is
   this repository exists as a directory;
2. every ApplicationSet list element expands to a directory that exists (the template path is
   `k8s/apps/{{.name}}`, so the element list and the directory tree have to agree);
3. the reverse: every directory under `k8s/apps/` is claimed by *something* — an ApplicationSet
   element or an explicit Application. A directory with no owner is silently undeployed, which is
   how `cheatsheet` sat in the tree after its element was removed;
4. `helm.valueFiles` entries that resolve into this repository (the `$values/...` form) exist.

Scope: this is the half of CI-002 that does not depend on the CLUSTER-002 restructure. CI-002's other
half — kubeconform against the CRDs catalogue, including `clusters/**` and `bootstrap/` — lands with
that restructure, because the paths it validates do not exist yet.

Exit: 0 clean, 1 on any finding.
